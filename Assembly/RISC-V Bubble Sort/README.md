# RISC-V 32-bit Assembly - Bubble Sort

## Overview

This program is designed for the "Computer Architecture and Organization" course's Evaluation 01 on Assembly Language Programming. It implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

## Program Description

The program initializes an array named vector with a size of 8 and prompts the user to enter values for each element. It then performs the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Assemble the desired code using a RISC-V assembler.
3. Run the assembled code on a RISC-V architecture simulator or hardware.
